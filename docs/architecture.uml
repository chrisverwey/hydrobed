note right of Home
	Central computer talks to a farm controller board on each farm via Wifi. 
	Each controller directs sensors and motors linked to driver boards 
	in different parts of the farms. 
	The controller is wired to driver boards (not Wifi).
	Driver boards are dumb. They take instructions from the controller.
	Each farm can have many driver boards each with a different sensor or motor
	suite attached, e.g. grow bed, sump, water reservoir, air quality, etc.
