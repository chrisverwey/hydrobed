A2Driver <-> S1Water : Read sensor

A1Driver <-> S2Bed : Read sensor 

note right
The driver boards read the sensor values frequently
to make sure they have the most up to date values
when the controller asks for an update

Controller -> A1Driver : Read sensors
A1Driver --> Controller : Sensor values

note right
Periodically the controller will request the latest
sensor values from all of its driver boards
and send these to the central server database.
